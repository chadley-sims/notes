Eradication
- Undoing the threat actor's actions
  - Containment is about stopping their operations
  - Eradication is about removing them
- Examples activities
  - Resotring systems from trusted backups
  - Removing threat actor processes, accounts
  - Performing a vulnerability assessment
- May also help meet goals such as recovery
  - Dealing with fraudulent transactions
  - Modified source code

Recovery
- Business needs to get back up and running
- Rebuilding a system is often the most cost effective
  - Not always possible
  - May consider shorter-term containment options as a band-aid to buy time
- Try to bring systems online during off-hours
  - Easier to monitor
  - This is a business decision... so you may be overruled

Remediation
- Try to identify and fix the root cause
- Compromise due to a weak password
  - Why was the weak password allowed? 
  - Can be difficult if multiple factors involved
- Closely monitor any compromised systems
  - A rootkit and/or backdoor suggests intent to return  
  - Monitor network sensors, host, and application logs
  - Look for incident-specific IOCs

Post-Incident
- Develop a final report (Tailor to your audience)
- Right after an incident, there is a lot of momentum
  - The impact fades over-time
- Schedule a follow-up review
  - What has been implemented?
  - Has the organization been compromised again? Original compromise?
  - Timeframe varies, but 30, 60, and 90-day increments are not uncommon

-Memory investigation steps are similar to live investigation steps
	- We use Volatility to analyze memory instead of PowerShell cmdlets
• The analysis process starts with the EOl
	- Suspicious process? Start with PsList and Ps Tree
	- Suspicious network listener? Start with NetScan, then move to processes
	- Suspicious program? Start with CmdLine, then processes
• Get in the habit of documenting your analysis process
	- Retain the results of Volatility plugin analysis by redirecting the output to a file
	- Add - g to suppress the Volatility progress indicator

- How do you know if an unknown program is evil?
	- Suspicious isn't necessarily malicious
	- Oddly named executables aren't enough, might still be benign
• How can you determine indicators?
	- Someone might have reverse engineered it already
	- But not always ... and sometimes signatures change
• Malware investigations can also feed threat intelligence
• Two basic approaches
	- Monitoring the environment: behavioral analysis
	- Examining code: static analysis

- Online engine that performs various types of automated analysis
• VirusTotal will run a specimen through several antivirus engines
	- Can purchase access to uploaded specimens
• Hybrid Analysis has sandboxes that run malware and record activity
	- Can choose if sample should be shared with community
	- Offers a commercial onsite product

- Minimize attack surface for the malware
Storm Center
• Never investigate malware on your day-to-day host... ever
	- An air-gapped system that you wipe after each use is ideal
• More common to use a VM
	- Use host-only (or equivalent) networking
	- Enable firewalls and other measures on the host
• Options for transferring data
	- USB devices
	- Temporarily-enabled virtual machine folders

Get-FileHash <file> - Calculate the SHA256 hash of a file on Windows

Monitoring the environment is a common strategy for investigating malware
• Basic strategy:
	- Get environment ready
	- Take a VM snapshot (if applicable)
	- Enable monitoring tools
	- Run malware
	- Interact with malware (optional)
	- Kill malware (optional)
	- Pause monitoring tools
	- Review output

Often requires some knowledge of the target language
	- Even a little understanding goes a long way
• IDA Pro is the most well-known tool in this area
	- Both disassembler and debugger
	- Optional decompiler (Hex-Rays)
	- Commercial
• Ghidra by NSA
	- Released as an open-source tool
	- Has support for collaboration
• Check out FOR610, SEC660 and SEC760 for more

LLM: a type of Al that uses a large data set of knowledge made
accessible through Natural Language
Processing (NLP)
• Generative Al: A type of Al that generates new content from an LLM
• GPT: Generative Pre-training
Transformer (GPT) is a breakthrough
NLP platform from OpenAl.com
	- Many details are not publicly available
	- Available on an experimental basis with subscriber options; limited API access

Problems with AI:
	- When they are wrong, they are confidently wrong
	- "Hallucinations"; hard time differentiating between creative and factual output

 • Influencing ChatGPT's output can improve the value of the results
	- Limit your output to no more than 300 words
	- Use vocabulary appropriate for a 10th grade reading level
	- Focus the results to recommendations for a manufacturing organization
	- Make the response appropriate for a non-technical executive
• You can also train ChatGPT with a sample of your own writing
	- Analyze the writing style sample inside triple quotes and call it My Style

Tips for using ChatGPT
	- Comply with employer rules
	- What is the impact od an OpenAI breach?
	- NOT a replacement for human analysis
	- Practice prompt engineering to refine the results
	- Watch for errors, like hallucinations

• Content is normalized using the nomenclature conventions adopted by ATT&CK
	- This gives you a consistent framework to work from when describing, documenting, and discussing attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures
• Cross-reference tools and techniques with ATT&CK identifiers
	- "Let's talk about password spray attacks" (Credential Access: TA0006)
	- "Donut injects shellcode into existing assemblies and payloads" (Process Injection:
T1055)
• Validation for attack tool and defense realism

- An attacker may start with a single domain name as a target
- What else can they discover for targets to attack
	- Subdomains
	- Partner and Subsidiary Organizations 
	- Non-production systems

	DNS Zone Transfer
- DNS servers may respond to zone transfer requests
	- Intended for replication from primary DNS to backup DNS servers
	- Uncommonly found on public DNS servers, more likely on internal DNS
	- Zone transfers should only be done in the internal network

	Certificate Transparency
• Modern browsers detect untrusted website certificates
• Modern browsers do not do well detecting malicious certs issued by trusted CAs
• Certificate transparency requires CAs to publish certificate issuance logs
	- Open to scrutiny to look for suspicious certs
• Gather information about targets, which CAs are in use, when certs are renewed, and more

• Subfinder automates subdomain and host enumeration
	- Using several online sources
	- Some sources require registration and/or commercial subscriptions
• Simplifies discovery, but does not replace manual assessment

	Defenses against DNS enumeration
- Do not allow zone transfers from just any system
- Use Split DNS
	- Only include external name information in external DNS servers
- Inspect DNS server logs
	- Look for failed and successful zone transfers
	- Large number of requests from a single source (DNS brute)
	- Use attacking IP to inform threat intelligence efforts
- Use common sources of target enumeration as part of a Cyber Threat Intelligence Program

• Browse the site to collect information about files, resources
	- Look for email addresses, location(s), partner organizations, PDFs, Office documents, images, etc.
	- Use built-in search for discovery
• Use the browser console to gather link information
	- Network data
	- JavaScript Console

• CeWL: Custom Wordlist Generator by Robin Wood
• CeWL crawls a target website and collect all web pages and common document formats (MS Office, PDF, images)
	- Extracts content, metadata, and other strings to one or more files
	- Useful to build wordlist from a target site's content and metadata for later attacks (password attacks, host enumeration, and more)

Have I been Pwned can be used to look up emails you find and see if their credentials were associated with any breaches (this is cool!)

• Limit and control information
	- Know what information is given away and perform risk analysis
• Use offensive tools defensively
	- Most effective when implemented programmatically as part of CTI
• Limit data indexed by search engines using robots.txt
	- Be careful not to point attackers to your sensitive data

Cloud Scanning Process
	- Using reconnaissance, attacker indentifies likely cloud provider
		- DNS information, linked resources in website pages
		- Builtwith.com summarizes service providers for a given site
	- Attacker identifies IP range for provider, performs full scan
	- Leverages scan results to identify other systems for target discovery

Scanning Large Ranges - Masscan
	- Nmap is not ideal to scan millions of IP
	- Masscan separates the SYN send from the ACK receive code
		- Sender can fire-and-forget
		- Receiver identifies open/closed from response
		- By decoupling the two halves of the three-way handshake, speed is greatly improved
		- May send packets too fast for either network to handle
	- Masscan reveals a list of IP addresses listening on TCP/443
	- We can connect to the service and retrieve the certificate details
		- Reveals the certificate common name attribute 

EyeWitness
	- Will take screenshots of websites, VNC and RDP services
	- Can be very effective to sort through hundreds of websites

Cloud Scanning Defense
	- Most targets will not log half-open SYN scans
	- Many web servers will not log TLS-Scan access
	- As defenders we're interested in what happens after scanning
		- Web server logs reveal site crawling
		- Malformed requests or parameters to server-side code

SMB Security
	- SMB is an application layer protocol that implements file and printer sharing, authentication, remote admin, and other features
	- Why is SMB such a problem for modern networks
		- Configuration is often done by end-users (creating shares, choosing files to place on shares, defining security for file access controls
		- It is complex and has lots of legacy functionality to support
SMB Shares
	- Get-CimInstance -Class win32_share -ComputerName <ip> (Works for systems implementing CIM (Mostly Windows))
	- net.exe view \\<ip> /all (Works Windows AND non-Windows sytems)

Searching for SMB Shares - SMBeagle
	- smbeagle -c results.csv -n <ip>/cidr -u <user> -p <password> 

SMB Exploits
	- SMB is a complex protocol that has been around for a long time
	- Organizations mitigate these with regular patching

Identifying and Dropping SMB Sessions
	- Get-SmbSession
	- Get-SmbSession | Select-Object ClientComputerName, Dialect, SecondsExists, SecondsIdle
	- $Password = Read-Host -AsSecureString
	- Set-LocalUser -Name sec504 -Password $Password
	- Close-SmbSession -ClientComputerName 10.10.75.1 -Force

Preparation - Defenses Against Evil SMB Sessions
	- Block access to the following ports across network boundaries and local firewalls
		- TCP/445, UDP/445 TCP/135, TCP/137, UDP/138, TCP/139
		- In general, block all ports except those required
	- Alternative - explicitly permit these ports only from systems or networks that require SMB access to a specified destination
		- File servers and domain controllers
	- Private VLANs are useful to limit inter-workstation access
	- Check for access to the ports listed above in logs

Defense Spotlight - Hayabusa and Sigma Rules
	- Sigma is a signature format for describing threats from log data
		- Widely used by SIEM platforms
		- Sigma is for logging data what Snort is for network and YARA is for files
	- Hayabusa reads Windows event logs and applies Sigma rules for threat detection and timeline generation

About Hayabusa
	- Hayabusa reads from Windows event logs to identify threats and generate an event timeline
	- Uses both Hayabusa rules and imported Sigma rules for threat detection
	- Run on a standalone system or as part of the Velociraptor endpoint monitoring platform
		- Generates CSV, JSON output for integration with other tools
		- Fast command-line interface to search Windows event log data
		- Read data from a running system or saved event logs
Updating Hayabusa Rules
	- ./hayabusa.exe update-rules

How to leverage Hayabusa + Sigma Rules
	- Breadth of detection with Hayabusa + Sigma - fast assessment for thousands of IOC rules
	- Timeline generation and analysis - Investigate patterns across multiple systems by interrogating collective event log data
	- Review data in spreadsheet or Timeline Explorer
	- Consider integrating Hayabusa output with other tools - SIEM, Elasticsearch, Neo4j graphs, etc.
	- Leverage other Hayabusa commands for JSON output, searching

Password Guessing Attacks
	- Password guessing across the network
		- Identify a valid user ID
		- Create list of possible passwords
		- Try typing in each password
		- If system allows you in, success, if not, try again
	- Use a script or automated tool to improve speed and accuracy
		- Maximum speed typically between one guess every 3 seconds and at most 5 guesses per second
		- Much slower than password cracking attacks
	- Could trigger account lockout
	- Can also use a Spray attack, using multiple users but one password to avoid locking out a single account
THC Hydra Password Guessing
	- THC Hydra by van Hauser
		- Online password guessing tool
		- Target a single username and password, a list of usernames, or a list of password and usernames
		- Supports many protocols - SSH, RDP, SMTP, SMB, VNC
		- -l <username> -L <username list file> -p <password> -P <password list file> -t 4 (limits thread usage)

Password Guess Selection
	- To avoid account lockout, password guess and spray attacks use very short password lists
	- Choose common words, such as city names, company names, product names, and local sports teams
	- Choose names based on password reset intervals
		- Every 90 days, try Summer2023, Fall2023, etc.
	- Attacks will customize lists to match organizational password policies
	- PW_Inspector is a tool distributed by THC Hydra that allows you to filter a password list by requirements

Microsoft 365 Password Attacks
	- Cloud SaaS logins are almost universally public access
	- login.microsoft.com is an API endpoint for authentication
		- Used by many Microsoft 365 services
		- Returns detailed error status codes following login attempts

Azure Smart Lockout
	- On-by-default feature for Microsoft 365 authentication
	- Account lockout following multiple login failures for one account
	- Blocks IP address source following 10 unsuccessful login attempts (3 for Azure US.gov)
		- Default lockout duration is 60 seconds
		- Non-blocked IPs can still login to prevent DoS

FireProx and AWS API Gateway
	- Can use AWS API Gateway to masquerade your IP through serveral worker process's
	- FireProx does this for us, allowing us to bypass Azure Smart Lockout

Password Hashes
	- Several options for password hashes
		- Windows - LANMAN, NT
		- Linux/UNIX - DES, 3DES, MD5, Blowfish, SHA254, SHA512
		- CPU and memory intensive - PBKDF2, Scrypt, Yescrypt, Argon2
		- Many custom protocols and older algoriths as well

LANMAN Hashes
	- Legacy password hashing mechanism
		- Still used in older or upgraded Windows systems
	- Brute force attack with accelerated hardware
		- Alpha-numeric char - 15 sec.
		- Alpha-numeric-all symbols - 10 mins.

NT Hashes
	- Modern Windows systems use NT hashes
		- Preserves case sensitivity
		- Converts to unicode, then MD4 hashes
	- Not to be confused with NTLMv1 and NTLMv2
		- NTLM is an authentication protocol, not a hash function

Password Salting
	- A salt is something that is used to further defeat problems with hashes passwords
	- Adding a salt to a password adds randomness to the password hashes
	- The salt is a randomly selected string, but it is not a secret
	- The user isn't concerned with the salt. the OS adds it automatically when calculating the password hash
	- All Windows based passwords (NOT CLOUD) are not salted

Obtaining Windows Domain Controller Hashes
	- Obtain NTDS.dit and SYSTEM registry hive data
	- Built-in ntdsutil.exe allows an attacker to backup AD

Recognizing Windows Hashes
	- Hashdump and other tools show hashes as username:userid:LANMAN:NTHASH
	- Empty hashes are often retrieved by older tools, changing Windows encryption, and disabled protocols

UNIX and Linux passwords
	- Eearly UNIX and Linux systems stored password hashes with DES encryptino (often without a salt)
		- Usernames and password hashes stored in /etc/passwd file
	- Later, MD5 password hashes were used, followed by other forms, SHA, Blowfish etc.

Decoding UNIX/Linux Password Hashes
	- The password hash is the second colon-delimited field in the /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow file, $ indiciates sub-field elements
		- hash type
		- salt
		- crypt-encoded password hash

Password Hashing Rounds
	- Single-iteration password hashing is considered insecure
	- Linux MD5 hashing ($1) uses 1,000 rounds
	- Linux SHA-256 ($5) and SHA-512 ($6) hashing uses 5,000 rounds
	- This makes password cracking considerably slower for attackers 
		- Attackers counter with offloading onto GPUs

Mitigating GPU-Based Password Cracking
	- Password based key derivation function 2 (PBKDF2)
		- Uses a flexible number of rounds (2 hashes per round)
		- Widely used and recommended by NIST, may not mitigate GPU acceleration
	- Scrypt requires 1000x as much memory, which is hard for GPUs to accommodate in parallel
	- Argon2, Yescrypt modern alternatives with advanced features

Hashcat Potfile, Show, Left, User
	- Hashcat tracks cracked passwords in the potfile
		- Stored in hashcat.potfile file in the hashcat profile directory
	- You can examine cracked passwords with --show
	- You can examine uncracked password with --left

Hashcat Rules
	- In addition to flexible attack modes, Hashcat comes with password permutation rules
	- Rules files mutate a wordlist with variations
		- Toggle the case of each letter in the word
		- Replace e's with 3's, a's with 4's (leet speak)
		- Reverse words, capitalize the first letter, append a number, append a special character
	- Look at the Hashcat rules directory for examples

Preparation - Disable LANMAN Authentication
	- Stop storing LANMAN hashes by defining reg key
		- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
		- On the edit menu, click Add Key (DWORD), name NoLMHash
		- LM hashes disappear when user next changes password

Preparation - Password Complexity Tools
	- Windows include rudimentary password complexity enforcement
		- Can be enforced with Group Policy if you have Active Directory
	- UNIX systems can use Pluggable Authentication Modules
	- Avoid reset every 90 days policies
	- Makes it harder for sers to select and remember passwords

Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication
	- Multi-factor authentication is the best defence against password crackin attacks
	- Make MFA a requirement for any new system introduced into our organization 
	- Leverage FIDO2-compliant standards for interoperability across platforms

Cloud Spotlight - Insecure Storage
	- Fundamental cloud storage mechanism for modern applications
	- Early cloud storage systems defaulted to public access unless locked down otherwise
	- Many enterprises still create cloud storage with public access

Cloud Storage Access
	- Cloud storage providers provide universal HTTP access to data
		- Easy to access and for application integration
	- Endpoint URLs are consistent for each major cloud provider

Storage Scanning - AWS S3
	- Takes a wordlist of names and identifies if the bucket exists, and if it is accessible
		- Optionally download all available resources --download

Storage Scanning - Google Cloud Bucker
	- Identifies and enumerates permissions on Google Cloud Buckets
		- Uses a permutation wordlist to create common variations on a single bucket name or searches all bucket names in a supplied file
	- Does not download files, use gsutil
	- gcpbucketbrute.py -u -k <company name>

Azure Scanning - Basic Blob Finder
	- Accepts a list of accountname:containername  strings, identifies public Azure storage instances
		- Non-delimited strings are used as both the account and container name

What's the big deal?
	- Many cloud storage sites are public to deliver public files on websites
	- By accessing the file from the cloud provider instead of the website, an attacker can get a directory listing, the original source, and potentially more privileges
	- If bucket is listable, we can enumerate and download all files
	- If bucket is writable, anyone can upload files

Bucket Discovery - Creative Name Selection
	- Bucket discovery is about creativity in selecting names
	- Using the default wordlists for buckets is OK, but others have likely already scanned those names
		- Use creativity when finding bucket names

Netcat
	- Simply reads and writes data across network
	- Focus is on moving raw data between ports on systems

Netcat Client Mode
	- Client mode starts a connection to a specific port
	- Standard input is sent across network
		- Keyboard, redirected from a file or piped from an application
	- All data back from the network is put on standard output
	- Messages from the tool itself are sent to standard error

Netcat Listen Mode
	- Listen mode waits for connections on a specific port
	- All data received from the network is put on standard output

Netcat - Port Scanning
	- TCP and UDP port scanning
	- Linear scans or random scans
	- -z option for minimal data to be sent
	- -v tells us when a connection is made
	- -w3 means wait no more than 3 seconds on each port
	- Can scan from any source port and source routing supported
	- We can go further, connecting to various ports, entering data and recording the response

- mkfifo backpipe
- nc -l -p 2222 < backpipe | nc 10.10.10.100 80 > backpipe
