7. Find the cmdlet that is used to prompt the user for input.
  - Read-Host

Practical Exercise #2 - Running Cmdlets 

    1. Display a list of running processes.
  - Get-Process

    2. Display a list of all running processes that start with the letter "s".
  - Get-Process -Name s*

    3. Find the cmdlet and its purpose for the following aliases:

        gal - Get-Alias

        dir - Get-ChildItem

        echo - Write-Output

        ? - Where-Object

        % - ForEach-Object

        ft - Format-Table

    4. Display a list of Windows Firewall Rules.
  - Get-NetFirewallRule

    5. Create a new alias called "gh" for the cmdlet "Get-Help"
  - Set-Alias gh -Value Get-Help

Practical Exercise #3 - Variables

    1. Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.
  - $var1 = Random-Number -Minimum 25 -Maximum 50

    2. Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.
  - $var2 = Random-Number -Minimum 1 -Maximum 10

    3. Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.
  - $sum = $var1 + $var2

    4. Create a variable called "sub" that holds the difference of var1 and var2.
  - $sub = $var1 - $var2

    5. Create a variable called "prod" that holds the product of var1 and var2.
  - $prod = $var1 * $var2

    6. Create a variable called "quo" that holds the quotient of var1 and var2.
  - $quo = $var1 / $var2

    7. Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" + "var2" = "sum"

    8. Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" - "var2" = "sub"

    9. Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" * "var2" = "prod"

    10. Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" / "var2" = "quo"

$var1 = Get-Random -Minimum 25 -Maximum 50
$var2 = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 10
$sum = $var1 + $var2
$sub = $var1 - $var2
$prod = $var1 * $var2
$quo = $var1 / $var2
Write-Output "$var1 + $var2 = $sum"
Write-Output "$var1 - $var2 = $sub"
Write-Output "$var1 * $var3 = $prod"
Write-Output "$var1 / $var2 = $quo"
