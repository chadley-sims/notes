Practical Exercise #3 - Variables

    1. Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.
  - $var1 = Get-Random -Minimum 25 -Maximum 50

    2. Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.
  - $var2 = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 10

    3. Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.
  - $sum = $var1 + $var2

    4. Create a variable called "sub" that holds the difference of var1 and var2.
  - $sub = $var1 - $var2

    5. Create a variable called "prod" that holds the product of var1 and var2.
  - $prod = $var1 * $var2

    6. Create a variable called "quo" that holds the quotient of var1 and var2.
  - $quo = $var1 / $var2

    7. Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" + "var2" = "sum"

    8. Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" - "var2" = "sub"

    9. Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" * "var2" = "prod"

    10. Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:

        "var1" / "var2" = "quo"

$var1 = Get-Random -Minimum 25 -Maximum 50
$var2 = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 10
$sum = $var1 + $var2
$sub = $var1 - $var2
$prod = $var1 * $var2
$quo = $var1 / $var2
Write-Output "$var1 + $var2 = $sum"
Write-Output "$var1 - $var2 = $sub"
Write-Output "$var1 * $var3 = $prod"
Write-Output "$var1 / $var2 = $quo"


Practical Exercise #4 - The Pipeline

  

    1. Display the start time of the earliest and latest running processes
-  Get-Process | Where-Object processname -ne "Idle" | Sort-Object -property starttime | fl processname, starttime

    2. Identify a cmdlet that returns the current date and time then using this cmdlet and Select-object, display only the current day of the week
- (Get-Date).DayOfWeek

    3. Identify a cmdlet that displays a list of installed hotfixes.
- Get-Hotfix

    4. Extend the expression to sort the list by install date, and display only the install date and hotfix ID.
-  Get-HotFix | Sort-Object InstalledOn | fl InstalledOn, HotFixID

    5. Extend the expression further, but this time sort by description, include description, hotfix ID, and install Date.
-  Get-HotFix | Sort-Object Description | fl Description, HotFixID, InstalledOn


Practical Exercise #5 - Custom Object

Create a custom object that contains information about the host system using the following:

    Win32_ComputerSystem

    Win32_BIOS

    Win32_OperatingSystem

    Win32_LogicalDisk

ANSWER : $WMIObject = [PSCustomObject]@{
    "ComputerName" = "DESKTOP-5KJDVS2"
    "OperatingSystem" = "Microsoft Windows 10 Pro"
    "Version" = "10.0.17134"
    "Manufacturer" = "Dell Inc."
    "Disks" = "{\\DESKTOP-5KJDVS2\root\cimv2:Win32_LogicalDisk.DeviceID=C:,\\DESKTOP-5KJDVS2\root\cimv2:Win32_LogicalDisk.DeviceID=D:}"
}


Practical Exercise #6 - Comparison and Condition

    Find and extract the model number from the provided lines of text. If there isn’t a model number then display to the user that a model number wasn’t found

    Check both lines for model numbers and report individually the line and model number if found.

ANSWER: if ($line1 -match $reg) {
    $matches
} elseif ($line2 -match $reg) {
    $matches
} else {
    Write-Host "Model Number Not Found"
}


Practical Exercise #7 - Create Functions

  Function Get-OrdinalDate { 
    $date=(get-date).dayofyear
    $year=(get-date).year
    write-host $year"-"$date
}
  Function Get-SquareNum([Int]$num) {
    $result = $num * $num
    $result
}
  Function Get-Product($val1,$val2,$val3) { 
    return $val1 * $val2 * $val3
}



Practical Exercise #8 - Regex

Function Get-NetInfo {
  $pattern = '.*?((\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})'
  $netinfo = ipconfig
  $ip = $netinfo -match "IPV4$pattern" %{is($_ -match $pattern) {$Matches[1] }}
  $gw = $netinfo -match "Gateway$Pattern" | % {if($_ -match $pattern) {$Matches[1]}}
  "ip: {0}`nSubnet: {1}`nGateway: {2}" -f $ip, $subnet, $gw
}

Function Get-UrlInfo {
  $ips = @()
  $file = gc .\dns.txt
  $regex = '(www\.[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+\.(com|org|net))'
  #$regex = '(w{3}\.)(?<=[a-z]\.)(c-m){3}'
  foreach($line in $file) {
      if($line -match $regex) {
        $Matches[1]
        $ips += $Matches[1]
      }
  }
  $ips.count
  $ips | sort | group
}


Practical Exercise #9 - Reverse Arrays

##Create an array from a random number between -10 and 0 to a random number between 1 and 10
$array = -3..15
$array
$array = @Get-Random -Minimum -10 -Maximum 1)..(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum -21

$array
##create a variable that contains the contents of the array in reverse
$reverse = $array[($array.length-1)..0]
$reverse
