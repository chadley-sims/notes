Eradication
- Undoing the threat actor's actions
  - Containment is about stopping their operations
  - Eradication is about removing them
- Examples activities
  - Resotring systems from trusted backups
  - Removing threat actor processes, accounts
  - Performing a vulnerability assessment
- May also help meet goals such as recovery
  - Dealing with fraudulent transactions
  - Modified source code

Recovery
- Business needs to get back up and running
- Rebuilding a system is often the most cost effective
  - Not always possible
  - May consider shorter-term containment options as a band-aid to buy time
- Try to bring systems online during off-hours
  - Easier to monitor
  - This is a business decision... so you may be overruled

Remediation
- Try to identify and fix the root cause
- Compromise due to a weak password
  - Why was the weak password allowed? 
  - Can be difficult if multiple factors involved
- Closely monitor any compromised systems
  - A rootkit and/or backdoor suggests intent to return  
  - Monitor network sensors, host, and application logs
  - Look for incident-specific IOCs

Post-Incident
- Develop a final report (Tailor to your audience)
- Right after an incident, there is a lot of momentum
  - The impact fades over-time
- Schedule a follow-up review
  - What has been implemented?
  - Has the organization been compromised again? Original compromise?
  - Timeframe varies, but 30, 60, and 90-day increments are not uncommon

-Memory investigation steps are similar to live investigation steps
	- We use Volatility to analyze memory instead of PowerShell cmdlets
• The analysis process starts with the EOl
	- Suspicious process? Start with PsList and Ps Tree
	- Suspicious network listener? Start with NetScan, then move to processes
	- Suspicious program? Start with CmdLine, then processes
• Get in the habit of documenting your analysis process
	- Retain the results of Volatility plugin analysis by redirecting the output to a file
	- Add - g to suppress the Volatility progress indicator

- How do you know if an unknown program is evil?
	- Suspicious isn't necessarily malicious
	- Oddly named executables aren't enough, might still be benign
• How can you determine indicators?
	- Someone might have reverse engineered it already
	- But not always ... and sometimes signatures change
• Malware investigations can also feed threat intelligence
• Two basic approaches
	- Monitoring the environment: behavioral analysis
	- Examining code: static analysis

- Online engine that performs various types of automated analysis
	- Can save a lot of time!
• VirusTotal will run a specimen through several antivirus engines
	- Can purchase access to uploaded specimens
• Hybrid Analysis has sandboxes that run malware and record activity
	- Can choose if sample should be shared with community
	- Offers a commercial onsite product

- Minimize attack surface for the malware
	- Don't want to be the reason your organization is on the front page of the Internet
Storm Center
• Never investigate malware on your day-to-day host... ever
	- An air-gapped system that you wipe after each use is ideal
• More common to use a VM
	- Use host-only (or equivalent) networking
	- Enable firewalls and other measures on the host
• Options for transferring data
	- USB devices
	- Temporarily-enabled virtual machine folders

Get-FileHash <file> - Calculate the SHA256 hash of a file on Windows

Monitoring the environment is a common strategy for investigating malware
• Basic strategy:
	- Get environment ready
	- Take a VM snapshot (if applicable)
	- Enable monitoring tools
	- Run malware
	- Interact with malware (optional)
	- Kill malware (optional)
	- Pause monitoring tools
	- Review output

Often requires some knowledge of the target language
	- Even a little understanding goes a long way
• IDA Pro is the most well-known tool in this area
	- Both disassembler and debugger
	- Optional decompiler (Hex-Rays)
	- Commercial
• Ghidra by NSA
	- Released as an open-source tool
	- Has support for collaboration
• Check out FOR610, SEC660 and SEC760 for more
