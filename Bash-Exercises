1.   Activity: Using Brace-Expansion, create the following directories within the $HOME directory:

    1123
    1134
    1145
    1156

  A: cd $home
     mkdir {1123,1134,1145,1156}



2.  Use Brace-Expansion to create the following files within the $HOME/1123 directory. You may need to create the $HOME/1123 directory. Make the following files, but utilze Brace Expansion to make all nine files with one touch command.

Files to create:

    1.txt
    2.txt
    3.txt
    4.txt
    5.txt
    6~.txt
    7~.txt
    8~.txt
    9~.txt
  A: cd $HOME
     mkdir 1123
     cd 1123
     touch {1..5}.txt {6..9}~.txt



3.  Using the find command, list all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt.
  A: find $HOME/1123 -iname *.txt



4.  List all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt. Omit the files containing a tilde (~) character.
  A: find $HOME/1123 -iname '*.txt' | grep -v '~'



5.  Copy all files in the $HOME/1123 directory, that end in ".txt", and omit files containing a tilde "~" character, to directory $HOME/CUT.
  A: find $HOME/1123 -iname "*.txt" -exec grep -v "~" > $HOME/1123
cp -a $HOME/1123 $HOME/CUT
touch $HOME/CUT/{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.txt



6. Using ONLY the find command, find all empty files/directories in directory /var and print out ONLY the filename (not absolute path), and the inode number, separated by newlines.
  A: find /var -empty -printf '%i %f\n'



7. Using ONLY the find command, find all files on the system with inode 4026532575 and print only the filename to the screen, not the absolute path to the file, separating each filename with a newline. Ensure unneeded output is not visible.
  A: find / -inum 4026532575 -printf '%f\n'



8. Activity:

    Using only the ls -l and cut Commands, write a BASH script that shows all filenames with extensions ie: 1.txt, etc., but no directories, in $HOME/CUT.
    Write those to a text file called names in $HOME/CUT directory.
    Omit the names filename from your output.
  A:  ls -p "$HOME/CUT" | grep -v "/$" | grep -v "names" > "$HOME/CUT/names"


9. Write a Bash script using "Command Substitution" to replace all passwords, using openssl, from the file $HOME/PASS/shadow.txt with the MD5 encrypted password: Password1234, with salt: bad4u

    A: #!/bin/bash
        a="bad4u"
        b="Password1234"
        c=$(openssl passwd -1 -salt "$a" "$b")
        awk -F: -v awk_var="$c" 'BEGIN {OFS=":"} {$2=awk_var} {print $0}' ~/PASS/shadow.txt
10. Write a basic bash script that greps ONLY the IP addresses in the text file provided (named StoryHiddenIPs in the current directory); sort them uniquely by number of times they appear.

    A: grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' StoryHiddenIPs | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn


11. 
    Write a script which will find and hash the contents 3 levels deep from each of these directories: /bin /etc /var
    Your script should:
        Exclude file type named pipes. These can break your script.
        Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to separate files.
        Determine the count of files hashed in the file with hashes.
        Determine the count of unsuccessfully hashed directories.
        Have both counts output to the screen with an appropriate title for each count.


    A: #!/bin/bash
        A=$(find /bin /etc /var -maxdepth 3 ! -type p -exec md5sum {} \; > $HOME/goodhash 2>$HOME/badhashes)
        B=$(cat $HOME/goodhash | wc -l)
        C=$(cat $HOME/badhashes | grep -v "Permission denied" | wc -l)

        echo "Successfully Hashed Files:" $B
        echo "Unsuccessfully Hashed Directories:" $C
