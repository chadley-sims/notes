		Day 2 
-------------------------------------
nmap scanning: use -oA to output all formats, list a directory and file name with it
Vulnerabilities:
	- Programming Related
		1. Connections
		2. Exploit Code
	- Misconfiguration
		1. Connections
		2. Username
		3. Password


Two ways to exploit a vulnerability:
	- Remotely: A vulnerability that can be exploited via the network
	- Locally: A vulnerability that can only be exploited from within the system (i.e. while logged in)

Consider during a vulnerability scan after you make it into the network to see things that you may not see from the outside

Three categories of automated vulnerability discovery scanners:
	- Attack Frameworks
		1. Core Impact
		2. Immunity Canvas
		3. Metasploit
	- System Scanners
		1. eEye Retina
		2. Nessus
		3. OpenVAS
	- Application-Specific
		1. Web Server Scanners
			- Nikto
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
perl nikto.pl [options]
  Options:
       -Cgidirs Scan these CGI dirs: 'none', 'all', or a value like '/cgi/'
       -cookies print cookies found
      -debug debug mode
       -findonly find http(s) ports only, don't perform a full scan
      -Format save file (-o) Format: htm, csv or txt (assumed)
       -generic force full (generic) scan
       -host + target host
       -id + host authentication to use, format is userid:password
       -nolookup skip name lookup
       -output + write output to this file
       -port + port to use (default 80)
       -root + prepend root value to all requests, format is /directory
       -ssl force ssl mode on port
       -timeout timeout (default 10 seconds)
       -useproxy use the proxy defined in config.txt
       -verbose verbose mode
       -vhost + virtual host (for Host header)
  Example: perl nikto.pl -host 192.168.0.5 –nolookup  -output niktoscan.txt               
                                 + requires a value

Exploitation
-------------
An exploit is any action or method that takes advantage of a vulnerability
	- can be destructive
	- effects can very
	- not always reliable
	- caution must be exercised
Considerations: 
	- Is the exploit trusted?
	- What does the exploit do?
	- What does the shell code do?
	- What will happen to the service?
Remote vs client-side Exploits
Typical usage scenarios = Initial attack vector, DoS attack

Goals
	- RCE (Remote Code Execution)
	- Denial of Service
Targets
	- Infrastructure Devices
		- Routers
		- Firewalls
		- IDS/IPS
	- Public facing & internal servers
	- End user workstations
Target publicily accessible systems and pivot further into the network
