Get-Command = tells you the cmdlets you can use
Get-Verb = tells you all the verbs you can use
Get-Command -Noun <noun> = tell you all the nouns you can use with that keyword

Basics
-----------
- Powershell searches for command in the order: Alias, Function, and then Cmdlet
- 'Get-help' will give you the command page for help, teaching you how to get help most efficiently
- 'Get-Help <cmdlet> -online' will bring you to the microsoft page online for that cmdlet
- 'Set-Alias' will make an alias that you declare
- 'Get-Alias -Defintion <Cmdlet>' will show you all the alias's for that specific cmdlet
- '(Get-Process)[0]' shows you the object in the array with that index number
- '(Get-Process <process>).kill' will kill the named process
- '((Get-Process)[index]).kill()' will kill the process marked by the index position


Pipes
----------
- The pipeline takes each thing in an array and runs the next cmdlet against each one
- The pipe variable is what is used to iterate
- $cols = @{Label="KB"; Expression = { [int]($_.Length/1KB) } }
Get-ChildItem | Format-Table Name, $cols
    - shows the KB usage of each process
- Must use the Pipe operator ( | )
- Write-Host can send the info straight to the user, while Write-Output must be used to be used in the pipeline


Variables
------------
- Assign variables with $ 
- Test-Path to test a variable
- Single qoutes will take a string literal, while double will print the value a variable holds
- $hour = (Get-Date).Hour ## Uses the hour of the day from Get-Date cmdlet
$remain = 24 - $hour
    - Shows how many hours are left in the day using variables


Automatic Variables
-----------------------
- Variables that are already made from the system and cannot be changed (ex. '$_' means the variable that is held by the pipeline)
- List of them can be found on the PNS COSC page for Powershell


Data Types
------------
- (cmdlet).GetType() shows the data type of a cmdlet
- $var = [int32](read-host) will take an input from the user and turn it into an integer
